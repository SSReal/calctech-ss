# Calctech - SS
### Made by Sajal Singhal (2021)

This is the first app that I made with React.js, also it was the first time I hosted an app on Heroku, so all-in-all a great learning experience

## Features
* Buttons to enter numbers, decimal point, etc.
* Hard-coded precision of 5 (may be changed later)
* Supports clear button to clear the input
* Supports delete button to delete a character of the input

## Test it out!
hosted on Heroku at [calctech-ss.herokuapp.com](calctech-ss.herokuapp.com)

## Find Bugs! & Suggest good programming practices!
As this is my first attempt at making a web app, I may have missed some important things, if so, please feel free to open issues regarding that.

### Made with React.js and Node.js
#### __Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
